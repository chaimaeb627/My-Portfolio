        My name is Chaimae Benali, I am twenty-one years old, and I am currently in my second year of computer engineering at ENSAO. Over the course of my studies, I have developed strong skills in programming , web development and Mobile Development , which I have put into practice through various academic projects. These projects have not only reinforced my technical knowledge but have also allowed me to cultivate teamwork and project management skills, essential in a collaborative setting. I am also passionate about continuous learning and always eager to explore new technologies, tools, and concepts.
